# Bank-Customers Dashboard Tableau 

# Problem Statement 

The goal of this project is to explore the provided Bank Customers dataset to create interactive visualizations that offer insights into various aspects of customer data. The visualizations will help in understanding the distribution of balances across regions, customer demographics by gender, job class performance, average balances by gender, and the relationship between age and balance.

# Recommendations

𝐅𝐮𝐫𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:

Consider exploring trends over time by analyzing the Date Joined
field. This could uncover seasonal patterns or changes in customer behavior.

𝐒𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬

Perform segmentation analysis to identify high-value customer profiles based on balance, age, and job classification.

𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:

Add trend lines or regression analysis to the scatter plot to better understand the relationship between age and balance.

𝐄𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐲:

Implement filters and drill-down options to allow users to explore specific regions, job classifications, or age groups in more detail.
